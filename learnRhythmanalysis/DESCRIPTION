Description: There are many proposed methods for circadian rhythm analysis. Often, it is unclear 
    where to start and what methods to choose? The choice depends on the type of data you have 
    (e.g., high-throughput omics data, continuous time reporter recordings) and the experimental 
    design. The goal of this tutorial is:
    i.	to introduce you to some standard approaches
    ii.	to make you aware of the limitations and caveats of the methods
    iii.	to enable you to spot basic problems with your data
    iv.	to direct you to resources to learn more
    v.	most importantly, to make you think about these issue BEFORE you design your experiments.
    This tutorial was made for Trainee Day, European Biological Rhythms Society Conference (EBRS) 2019.
