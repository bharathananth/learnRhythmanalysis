Circadian rhythms confer adaptive advantages by allowing organisms to anticipate daily changes in their environment. Over the last few years, many groups have used microarray technology to systematically identify genes under circadian regulation. We have extended on these studies by profiling the circadian transcriptome from the mouse liver and two immortalized cell lines at an unprecedentedly high temporal resolution. We identified over 3,000 different transcripts in the mouse liver that cycle with a period length of approximately 24 hours. To our surprise, we also identified two classes of genes which cycle with period lengths of 12 and 8 hours; i.e., harmonics of the circadian clock. Importantly, we were able to identify harmonics in five other tissue types; however, these rhythms were undetectable in disassociated cells. Moreover, harmonics were lost in the liver when mice are subjected to restricted feeding, suggesting that at least one component of circadian harmonics is driven by feeding.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are oscillations of physiology, behavior, and metabolism that have period lengths near 24 hours. In several model organisms and humans, circadian clock genes have been characterized and found to be transcription factors. Because of this, researchers have used microarrays to characterize global regulation of gene expression and algorithmic approaches to detect cycling. This article presents a new algorithm, JTK\_CYCLE, designed to efficiently identify and characterize cycling variables in large data sets. Compared with COSOPT and the Fisher’s G test, two commonly used methods for detecting cycling transcripts, JTK\_CYCLE distinguishes between rhythmic and nonrhythmic transcripts more reliably and efficiently. JTK\_CYCLE’s increased resistance to outliers results in considerably greater sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, JTK\_CYCLE accurately measures the period, phase, and amplitude of cycling transcripts, facilitating downstream analyses. Finally, JTK\_CYCLE is several orders of magnitude faster than COSOPT, making it ideal for large-scale data sets. JTK\_CYCLE was used to analyze legacy data sets including NIH3T3 cells, which have comparatively low amplitude oscillations. JTK\_CYCLE’s improved power led to the identification of a novel cluster of RNA-interacting genes whose abundance is under clear circadian regulation. These data suggest that JTK\_CYCLE is an ideal tool for identifying and characterizing oscillations in genome-scale data sets.},
